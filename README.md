# Builder
 - The `User` class represents a user with a first name, last name, optional age, and optional phone number. 
 - The `UserBuilder` class provides an interface for constructing `User` objects, ensuring that required fields (first name and last name) are provided.
# Factory
 - An abstract `Shape` class and concrete subclasses for  `Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Square`.
 - A `ShapeFactory` class is used to create instances of these shapes based on a given type.
 - The `Client` class then uses the factory to create and interact with the shapes.
# Singleton
- The `Database` class ensures that only one instance of itself can be created.
